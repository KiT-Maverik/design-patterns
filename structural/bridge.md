Split a large class or a set of closely related classes into abstraction and implementation.

Allows to develop abstraction and implementation independently of each other.

Abstraction is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isnâ€™t supposed to do any real work on its own.
It should delegate the work to the implementation layer (also called platform).
